# Ambient Dream Pedalboard

Published on: 2024-11-21

This pedalboard is my go-to for creating lush soundscapes and dreamy ambient textures. Each pedal has been carefully chosen for its ability to add depth, movement, and character to my sound.

## Pedalboard Setup

1. **Tuner**: **Boss TU-3 Chromatic Tuner**  
   The essential pedal to keep everything perfectly in tune.

2. **Compressor**: **Walrus Audio Deep Six V3**  
   Adds sustain and evens out dynamics for smooth playing.

3. **Overdrive**: **EarthQuaker Devices Westwood**  
   A transparent overdrive that keeps things warm and natural.

4. **Reverb**: **Strymon BigSky**  
   The heart of the board, capable of creating endless lush reverbs.

5. **Delay**: **Electro-Harmonix Canyon**  
   Offers a wide range of delay modes, from analog warmth to shimmer.

6. **Chorus**: **MXR M234 Analog Chorus**  
   Adds movement and depth to clean tones for an ethereal vibe.

7. **Looper**: **TC Electronic Ditto X2 Looper**  
   Perfect for building ambient layers and experimenting with textures.

## Signal Chain

The signal starts at the tuner and flows through the compressor, overdrive, and modulation pedals before reaching the delay and reverb. The looper sits at the end to capture the complete soundscape.

## Power Supply

This board is powered by a **Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus**, ensuring reliable power and minimal noise.

## What's Next

I plan to experiment with adding a shimmer reverb pedal or a granular delay to further expand the sonic possibilities.
