Published on: 2024-11-21

As a guitarist, my rig plays a huge role in shaping my sound. Here’s a breakdown of my dream guitar setup for both live performances and studio work.

## Guitars

1. **Fender American Professional II Stratocaster**  
   A versatile beast, perfect for anything from blues to rock. I love the comfortable neck and the classic tone from the single-coil pickups.

2. **Gibson Les Paul Standard '50s**  
   When I need a warm, fat tone for heavier songs, this Les Paul delivers every time.

## Amplifiers

- **Vox AC30**  
  This amp is my go-to for its chimey cleans and natural overdrive when pushed hard. It pairs wonderfully with most of my pedals.

- **Marshall DSL40CR**  
  For those high-gain moments, the DSL40CR provides plenty of crunch and sustain.

## Pedalboard

Here’s where the magic happens:

- **Boss TU-3 Tuner**: Always start with a reliable tuner.
- **Ibanez Tube Screamer TS9**: A classic for boosting solos and adding creamy overdrive.
- **Strymon BigSky**: My favorite reverb pedal, perfect for ambient soundscapes.
- **Electro-Harmonix Memory Man**: Adds warm, analog delay to my tone.
- **MXR Phase 90**: For some extra movement and texture in clean passages.
- **Boss RC-5 Loop Station**: Great for building layers during practice and live gigs.

## Strings and Accessories

- **Ernie Ball Regular Slinky Strings (10-46)**  
  These strings strike the perfect balance between tone and playability.

- **Dunlop Tortex Picks (0.73mm)**  
  Durable and grippy, these picks have been my favorite for years.
